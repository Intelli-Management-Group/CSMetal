The CS Metal data protection procedure is a company-wide procedure ensuring a minimum standard of protection for personal data shared at global level.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use personal data obtained through this Website (<a href="http://corporate.csmetal.com">corporate.csmetal.com</a>). Some online forms may have a specific Policy or Privacy Statement that differs from this Privacy Policy. Please review the Policy or Privacy Statement for any information that applies specifically to that particular form.</p>

                <div class="title">Personal Data</div>
                <p>In general, you are not required to disclose your personal data as a condition of using this Website. No personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, or e-mail address, is automatically collected from your visit to the Website.</p>

                <p>Personally identifiable information is never sold or leased to any third parties outside of CS Metal.

Applicants have the right to consult their personal data, to correct the personal data, if necessary, and to withdraw their consent to the use of their personal data. For this purpose applicants may contact the recipient of the application at the e-mail address to which they have sent the application.</p>
